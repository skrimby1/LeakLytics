# IoT Water Leak Detection System

An IoT device designed to detect water leaks and instantly notify users via **WhatsApp** or **Email**.  
Includes custom **hardware design** (schematic + PCB layout + BOM) and **firmware/software** implementation with ESP32, featuring a **captive portal system** for Wi-Fi configuration through a local webserver.

## üîß Features
- Real-time water damage detection - uses resistive cables to detect water leak
- Automatic user notifications (WhatsApp & Email)  
- Captive portal for Wi-Fi setup (ESP32-hosted webserver)  
- Custom PCB prototype with outsourced production
